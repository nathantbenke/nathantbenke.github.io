            Concept Overview
        </h3>
        <h5 class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-remove-top uk-light uk-margin-xlarge-right">
            Card games are one of the most popular mediums for games and have existed for over a <b>MILLENNIUM</b>. Within the past century, a new style of card game has gained 
            much popularity in which players use monsters to battle each other. Some of the biggest modern franchise follow this premise such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Magic the Gathering. 
            Each of these games have been popular for decades and have risen to have over 10,000 unique playable cards that players can collect. <br> <br>

        </center>
            <br>
            Many of these card games have inspired TV shows in which these monsters battle in real life using attributes based from the cards. With so many variations of 
            these expansive monster card games, it has slowly gotten harder and scarier for new players to adopt the game. This brought our group to create 
            <strong> AUGMENTED DUELISTS</strong>!

            Augmented Duelists is a AR cards game which inspired from elements from many of the most popular games including Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Hearthstone. 
            An augmented reality app built in Lens Studio that allows for the players to print and use custom monster and action cards to battle <strong> IN THE REAL WORLD!</strong>
            Each monster card comes with its own unique attack set and animations! With this visual depiction, it is easy for new players to follow along with the instructions and play!

            Augmented Duelists takes what we saw as some of the best elements from the most popular games such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Hearthstone and attempted to
            combine them into one. The style of combat was inspired from Pokemon in which monsters with unique attack sets battle 1v1. Along with Yu-Gi-Oh! and Hearthstone,
            monsters have differing attack and defense stats.

        Reflection
        </h2>
        <h4 class="uk-light uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-remove-top uk-margin-xlarge-right"> 

        Though there were many changes that needed to be made to our initial plan, we were able to achieve the key aspects of why we wanted to create the game.
        We were able to make a complete game where the user could use monster cards to battle an opponent. Each of the cards had an associated model that could be 
        brought to life with it's own custom animations. We were also able to make the game easy to understand by the instructions built into the UI. 
        Though simplistic, we were able to capture some of the key elements that made the TV shows so popular.  

        <br><br>

        We had to change many of our initial ideas, much due to the foreseen obstacles brought upon by using Lens Studio. We had originally wanted to use Unity, 
        however due to the challenges with Windows to iPhone integrations, we had to switch to Unity. For both Joseph and myself, we had little to no experience in 
        both Lens Studio and JavaScript. This caused for a major drop in our productivity to due these factors as ideas that would be easy to implement in Unity were 
        much harder, different, or impossible in Lens Studio. Throughout the development process, we discovered issues with Lens Studio such as the marker limit, 
        the marker sensing limit, and the various sharing issues involved in collaborating with GitHub. Much of my time personally, was spent researching, restructuring,
        and resetting the projects due to the data loss whenever members would upload.

        <br><br>

        I believe overall the work was fairly evenly distributed. Jake focused mainly on the visual side by creating the marker art, models, and animations. Joseph worked
        mainly on game scripts including game logic, debugging, and various mechanical features. I took on a majority of the UI work along with larger project management 
        role which include fixing and resetting project structuring and frequent individual meetings with both Jake and Joseph in order to make sure everyone understood 
        their tasks and the desired outputs. I also took a smaller role in the scripting of game logic and debugging.
