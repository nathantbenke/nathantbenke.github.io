        Through this project, I had the opportunity to merge many of my passions. Being 
        someone with a deep background in both music and drumming, having the chance to 
        create something within this space through my programming, modelling, graphics 
        backgrounds, was a very exciting opportunity. This journey of creating a musical 
        immersive experience deeply resonated with both my artistic and technical sides.

            Concept Overview
        </h3>
        <h5 class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-remove-top uk-light uk-margin-xlarge-right">
            When discussing different possibilities for our project, one of the biggest reasons we were led towards VR drumming was because of how users would be able to interact with the experience.
            There aren't many virtual music applications that could be accurately portrayed in virtual reality, simply due to the complexity of most instruments. However, with drums, all a musician needs are 
            a set of drums and sticks. This type of experience would also let us explore developing a seated VR experience, which is atypical about VR applications. With the 
            prospects of being able to create a realistic, fun, and educational virtual experience, we were sold on BeatBoxVR.

            <strong> BeatBoxVR</strong>, is a VR Drums experience that allows for the user to experience their 
            greatest drumming fantasy! Our aim was to develop a portable and entertaining VR drum experience, allowing you to enjoy 
            a rock concert anytime, anywhere. Through the utilization of VR technology, we hoped to leverage the headsets capabilities to create an interactive
            3D environment with realistic audio, haptic feedback, and visual effects. With a variety of environments and drum cosmetics, we hoped that there would 
            be a little something for everyone. We hoped that our product could be used by a wide range of drumming enthusiasts, regardless of their experience with VR or drumming. 
            This is what brought us to creating educational tutorial modes along with challenge and play along modes, allowing for the user to drum and learn at their own pace.

            Related Material
        </h2> 
        <h5 class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-remove-top uk-margin-xlarge-right uk-light">
            During the early stages of prototyping and designing our product, there were two main games that were used as key references,<strong> Rock Band </strong>and<strong> Beat Saber</strong>.
            For Rock Band, we felt that the approach they used for the drum instrument was very effective in making it easy for the user to comprehend how to approach playing the accompanying 
            drum kit, regardless of experience. For Beat Saber, we used this as the base for understanding how to effectively approach developing a rhythm game in virtual reality. This 
            brought on ideas for different cosmetics and environment customizations as well as how we could effectively leverage visual effects with VR controllers.
        
        
            <br><br>

            Another step we took to prepare was to look at some of the existing VR drumming applications in order to see how they approached different challenges. We ended up looking through 
            several applications including <strong> Paradiddle</strong> and <strong> VR Drums Ultimate Streamer</strong>. From looking at these applications, we felt that 
            the key differences between the applications were how realistic the graphics were. This helped us decide on a semi-realistic theme early in the process. This also 
            helped us learn how different applications were dealing with the lack of kick and hi-hat pedals. Most applications seemed to simply use the triggers on the controllers, 
            so, we decided to do the same.

                    In order to match that of a normal audio player, I implemented typical commands which would allow for the user to play/pause the current song while also skipping forward
                    or backwards by 10 seconds. I also worked to implement a scrub feature so that, by pointing the ray and clicking on the lower bar it would accurately fill the bar and calculate
                    the approximate time in which it correlated to in the current song.

                    the textures. I also remade the customization page to have shifting functionality rather than having everything on the screen at once.

                    One of the key issues that we ran into was improper scene optimization. There were many cases where 3D objects or lighting data was too complex, which caused for the 
                    headset to lag. I worked to help optimize or remove broken elements throughout the built environment scenes.

                        Finally, I created a new scene within the Unity project that would play the video and transition to the main scene with the SceneManager. This would make it so that upon loading up BeatBoxVR, the intro would play in 
                            headset before transitioning into the recording studio.

                            First, to get the samples, I went into Ableton and used a VSTPlugin that I had purchased in the past called Abbey Road | 60s Drummer.
                            Here I was able to process various drum samples for all the necessary drums and cymbals with custom mixing along with presets of various styles
                            including Soul, Jazz, Rock n Roll, and more!

                        Second, once I had the samples, I had to refactor the SoundManager in Unity. Because it was previously meant to only support the single kit, I had to create
                        a new array which could not only hold all of the samples, but could then pass those values into the original Percussion Sounds array. This needed to be done because
                        Percussion Sounds was being used in various other places throughout the project and would have required unnecessary refactoring

                        Finally, in order for people to access it, I added a new section into the customization settings. This however, caused for them to be pushed off the screen which lead
                        to be implementing a scroll feature. This could be used in the future if we were to add further items in the customization settings.

        Reflection

            I believe our project achieved the fundamental goals we set in our original plan. During our initial pitch, we were skeptical about being able to get the 
            song mode working effectively in a way that could be easily enjoyed by the user. Reflecting on this assumption, we not only created 2 playable songs in song mode, 
            but we also added a tutorial mode which we had originally not planned on implementing. With this addition, we created a fully immersive VR drumming experience that was 
            educational and entertaining. Having been nominated as Finalist in the Innovate Tech Awards as well as having multiple outside parties querying about further development, 
            I am confident in the product that we set out to create. 

        <br><br>

        Personally, I believe that the biggest challenge that I dealt with was working through scene optimization. This was an area I was unfamiliar with. This was mostly 
        due to my not being familiar with the limitations in which the VR headsets were strained by. Nearly all of the development that I have done involving 3D modelling has 
        been for computer applications which typically run far more smoothly than VR programs. As a result of this experience, when I first loaded up my program, it ran extremely 
        slow due to the number of lights and complex models. One of the key challenges in scene optimization is finding the right balance of aesthetics and performance. For a drumming 
        application, it was important that the scene was as efficient as possible for the drums to be as responsive to hits as possible. In order to create visually appealing environments 
        while remaining efficient, I had to do a fair amount of research into understanding the key techniques for optimizing rendering. In the future I will pay far more attention to the 
        number of lights being used in the scene as well as making better decisions on what objects could simply be 2D textures rather than full 3D models. 

        <br><br>

        I believe overall that the team was very well balanced. Everyone on the team had diverse backgrounds in their personal skill sets, which made it much easier to divvy out tasks which people could complete.
         On top of that, the entire team was very effective in working together to solve any dire issues that would arise 
        involving unknown errors or bugs that were occurring.
