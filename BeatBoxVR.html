            Through this project, I had the opportunity to merge many of my passions. Being someone with a deep background in both music and drumming, 
            having chance to create something within this space through my programming, modelling, graphics backgrounds, this was a very exciting opportunity.
            This journey of creating a musical immersive experience deeply resonated with both my artistic and technical sides. <br><br>

            Concept Overview

            When discussing different possibilities for our project, one of the biggest reasons we were led towards VR drumming was because of how users would be able to interact with the experience.
            There aren't many virtual music applications that could be accurately portrayed in virtual reality, simply due to the complexity of most instruments. However, with drums, all a musician needs are 
            a set of drums and sticks. This type of experiences would also allow for us to explore developing a seated VR experience, which is fairly atypical in regards to VR applications. With the 
            prospects of being able to create a realistic, fun, and educational virtual experience, we were sold on BeatBoxVR.

            <strong> BeatBoxVR </strong>, is a VR Drums experience that allows for the user to experience their 
            greatest drumming fantasy! Our aim was to develop a portable and entertaining VR drum experience, allowing you to enjoy 
            a rock concert anytime, anywhere. Through the utilization of VR technology, we hoped to leverage the headsets capabilities to create an interactive
            3D environment with realistic audio, haptic feedback, and visual effects. With a variety of environments and drum cosmetics, we hoped that there would 
            be a little something for everyone. We hoped that our product could be used by a wide range of drumming enthusiast, regardless of their experience with VR or drumming. 
            This is what brought us to creating educational tutorial modes along with other challenge and play along mode, allow for the user to drum and learn at their own pase.

            Augmented Duelists takes what we saw as some of the best elements from the most popular card battle games such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Hearthstone and 
            attempts to combine them into one. The style of combat was inspired from Pokemon in which monsters with unique attack sets battle in a 1 versus 1 until all 
            of the enemies' monsters have been defeated. This aspect takes some inspiration from the video game along with the card game. Along with Yu-Gi-Oh! and 
            Hearthstone, monsters have differing attack and defense stats.

         For my additional feature, I decided to follow the professors recommendation by adding music! For this, I created a custom song composed in Ableton. I wanted for
         it to follow the theme/style of the game which with low poly which led me to creating 8-bit/chiptune.

        Reflection
        </h2>
        <h4 class="uk-light uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-remove-top uk-margin-xlarge-right"> 

        Though there were many changes that needed to be made to our initial plan, we were able to achieve the key aspects that wanted for our game.
        We were able to make a complete game where the user could use monster cards to battle an opponent. Each of the cards had an associated model that could be 
        brought to life with its own custom animations. We were also able to make the game easy to understand by the instructions built into the UI. 
        Though simplistic, we were able to capture some of the key elements that made the TV shows so popular.  

        <br><br>

        We had to change many of our initial ideas, much due to the unforeseen obstacles brought upon by using Lens Studio. We had originally wanted to use Unity, 
        however due to the challenges with Windows to iPhone integrations, we had to switch to Unity. For both Joseph and myself, we had little to no experience in 
        both Lens Studio and JavaScript. This caused a major drop in our productivity due to how many of our ideas that would be easy to implement in Unity were much harder, 
        different, or impossible in Lens Studio. Throughout the development process, we discovered issues with Lens Studio such as the marker limit, 
        the marker sensing limit, and the various sharing issues involved in collaborating with GitHub. Much of my time personally, was spent researching, restructuring,
        and resetting the projects due to the data loss whenever members would upload.

        <br><br>

        I believe overall the work was fairly evenly distributed. Jake focused mainly on the visual side by creating the marker art, models, and animations. 
        Joseph worked mainly on game scripts including game logic, debugging, and various mechanical features. I took on a majority of the UI work along with a larger project
         management role which included fixing and resetting project structuring and frequent individual meetings with bothJake and Joseph in order to make sure 
         everyone understood their tasks and the desired outputs. I also took a smaller role in the scripting of game logic and debugging.
